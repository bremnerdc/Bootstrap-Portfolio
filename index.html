    <div class="pull-left">My name is Dylan Bremner. I was born in Laguna Beach, CA at the ripe old age of ZERO days old. I moved to Seattle
      when I was little, and lived in the Seattle area through my school years. After high school I decided to get the hell out of this 
      crazy, grey, rainy place and moved back to my home state of California. There I went to school and generally just hung out and had the time 
      of my life before I finally had to join the real world at the age of 21. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I moved back up to the Seattle area for awhile, but I still just couldn't
      handle this weather for very long, so after a couple years I ended up moving to Auckland, New Zealand. It was in Auckland where I ended up meeting 
      my wife, and we both decided that although we loved New Zealand - it wasn't quite for us, so we decided to move back to the States.
      It wasn't quite that simple though, my wife is not a US Citizen - she needed a green card - so we hired an attorney, applied for a green card, and waited.
      The attorney said the process could take anywhere from 8 months to 2 years! And in that time my wife could not set foot in the United States.
      So we did what any rational couple would do in this situation - travel the world! 
      <br>
      <br>
      In the two year time span we ended up travelling to 20 something countries and 6 continents. Finally
      she got the call that her visa was processed, so we both moved back to Seattle in 2018, and we've been here ever since. Since moving here she landed a 
      job at Amazon Web Services as a recruiter, and I now am working at Weyerhaeuser as a Technical Solutions Analyst. </div>
